	******** \HLP directory contents ********
	QB45ENER.HLP		File containing	on-line	help information dealing with
									the QuickBASIC environment and error messages.
	QB45QCK.HLP			File containing on-line help on QuickBASIC.
	QB45ADVR.HLP		File containing on-line help information on QuickBASIC.
	
	******** \INC directory contents ********
	DEMO1.BAS				A BASICA version of a sound-effects demonstration
									program.
	DEMO2.BAS				The QuickBASIC 2.0 version of DEMO1.BAS.
	DEMO3.BAS				The QuickBASIC 4.0 (and	higher)	version	of DEMO1.BAS.
	QCARDS.BAS			Supplied code for the QCARDS database program used
									in the Hands On	with QuickBASIC	tutorial. In Part 2
									of the manual Learning to Use QuickBASIC, you add
									the module-level code that completes this program.
	QCARDS.DAT			Supplied data file for the QCARDS database program.
									Keep this file in the current directory	as you add
									code during the	QCARDS.BAS tutorial.
	REMLINE.BAS			A utility program that converts	BASICA programs
									saved in ASCII format to QuickBASIC-style programs
									by removing unreferenced line numbers.
	SORTDEMO.BAS		A program that uses multicolored bars and sound to
									illustrate various sorting algorithms.
	TORUS.BAS				A graphics demonstration program that draws a
									multicolored doughnut-shaped figure on the screen,
									then animates it by shifting colors in the palette.
	QB.BI						An include file	for use	with BASIC programs that
									call any of the	following routines in the QB.QLB
									Quick library or in the	QB.LIB stand-alone library:
									ABSOLUTE, INTERRUPT, INTERRUPTX, INT86OLD, or
									INT86XOLD.  The	QB.BI file defines the types for
									arguments passed to these routines and also gives
									DECLARE	statements for these routines.
	NOEM.OBJ				(NO EMulation).	An object file to link with BASIC
									programs that will always be run on machines with an
									8087 or	80287 math coprocessor chip.  Linking with
									NOEM.OBJ turns off software emulation of the math
									chip's function, and reduces the size of the
									executable file.
	SMALLERR.OBJ		An object file to link with BASIC programs that	do
									not require run-time error messages. Linking with
									SMALLERR.OBJ reduces the size of executable files
									that do	not need run-time error	messages.
	QB.PIF					A file that provides information to aid	in running
									QuickBASIC under Microsoft Windows.

												the pattern begins.
		SINEWAVE.BAS				A program that plots the graph of the sine-wave
												function for angle values from 0 to PI radians.
		STRTONUM.BAS				A program that converts	to a numeric value any number
												input as a string, after first filtering invalid
												numeric	characters (such as commas) out	of the
												string.
		TERMINAL.BAS				A program that turns your computer into	a "dumb"
												terminal when used with	a modem.
		TOKEN.BAS						A program that breaks an input string into a series
