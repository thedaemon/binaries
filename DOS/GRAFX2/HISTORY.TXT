HISTORY of GRAFX: (in chronological order: latest version at the end)

* GRAFX 1.0á -> 1.02 (09/??/1995 -> 07/??/1996)
        Forget it!

* GRAFX 2.00 Beta 90% (11/01/1996) - Wired'96 release
        This version was 1st shown at the Wired'96 demo party in Belgium.
        We gave it to many people there, so let's start history from here.
        Note that there were a few different "90%" versions because we didn't
        want to change the number just for tiny bug-fixes.

* GRAFX 2.00 Beta 91% (11/20/1996)
        - Fixed: Terrific bug in Help/Messages (one line was too long and
        crashed the program!).
        - Added: Some new parameters for the settings.
        - Added: Now, you can automatically set the best resolution for the
        picture loaded and/or slightly adapt the picture to keep the colors of
        the menu (for those who want to use GrafX2 as a viewer).
        - Fixed: Bug that occured when you wanted to restore your previous
        brush while being in "grab brush" mode.
        - Added: English user's manual written (will be updated later, and
        translated into French).
        - Fixed: No more displays pixels out of the preview window when
        loading corrupt pictures.
        - Fixed: Small bug in LBM loading (for non-standard widths).
        - Fixed: Minor error when saving the original screen dimensions in PKM
        files. (we didn't save words with Intel conventions)
        - Fixed: Exactly the same bug for LBM (but with Motorola conventions)
        - Removed: No more saving the current palette when exiting the program
        (that was useless and boring when pictures had a weird palette).

* GRAFX 2.00 Beta 92% (11/27/1996)
        - Fixed/Removed: Error message occuring when accessing a drive with no
        disk or so finally suppressed!
        - Fixed: BMP loading was almost completely bugged and it should now be
        completely debugged.
        - Fixed/Modified: Set_palette routine (the previous one was fast but
        did not work with some weird cards that don't support a REP OUTSB).
        - Added: Multi-Undo.
        - Added: Backup (*.BAK) files.

* GRAFX 2.00 Beta 93% (12/12/1996)
        - Fixed: Bug that occured when approaching the borders of the screen
        in grid mode with the type of cursor used for brush grabbing.
        - Fixed: Small but annoying bug when saving files with a name of 9
        characters.
        - Fixed: Saved PAL files no longer modify the picture's name (some
        mistake must have been done when we implemented the backup option).
        - Added: Now, you can stop the loading of previews by pressing a key.
        - Improved: Video cards that don't use the same VESA bank for reading
        and writing should now work correctly.
        - Improved: Frame displayed around the magnifier's preview.
        - Improved: Menu of resolutions completely modified, and many new
        modes added.
        - Modified: The default colors of the menu have been slightly
        lightened.
        - Improved: The whole configuration is now saved and reloaded in the
        settings menu.

* GRAFX 2.00 Beta 94.0|1|2% (02/13-23/1997) - ACE CD #4 & Volcanic3 releases
        (These different versions were too close from each other to be
        separated in this file. Just check the last modifications to know
        which version you have)
        - Added/Improved: (approximative) HAM6 and HAM8 support in IFF(LBM)
        files, and improved compatibily with Amiga IFF files => should be

        was displayed at the end of the list when current mode was 640x512).
        - Added: English user's manual translated into French (and corrected..
        There can be bugs in text files :)).

        coordinates in the settings menu.

        any more.
        - Fixed: The VESA modes are no longer disabled for some video cards.
        - Imporoved: "Windows 95" keys are now usable.
        - Modified: We now use the EOS dos-extender Copyright (c) 1996 by
        Eclipse, so read carefully the docs if you can't use GrafX2 anymore.

* GRAFX 2.00 Beta 95% (07/18/1997) - Wired'97 release
        (It's GrafX2 creation's 1st anniversary! =D     (...but still Beta :/)
        We wrote the usual "void main(int argc, char * argv[])" one year ago!)
        - Fixed: PCX files with odd widths should be supported now. (We fixed
        a bug in version 94.1% which added a new one) :(
        - Fixed: Small display bug in the grid of the Sieve menu.
        - Fixed: Oops! We forgot to remap the colors of the menu when loading
        a PAL file. That's stupid! :)
        - Improved: The number of predefined paintbrushes has been doubled.
        - Added: Outline and Nibble effects for brushes.
        - Improved: The "Brush grabbing", "Zoom" and "Pipette" options are no

        - Added: A small preview of the color selected by the pipette is
        displayed in the tool-bar.
        - Fixed: GIF saving (the bug didn't corrupt the file but resulted in a
        file that wasn't as well compressed as it should have been).
        - Fixed: GIF loading doesn't flash any more on some pictures that were
        not corrupt; and LBM neither when loading is interrupted by user.
        - Added: Menu where you can choose what you want to copy to the spare
        page (pixels, palette, or both...).
        - Modified: The size of the palette editor has been very slightly
        reduced.
        - Modified: The Stencil is now taken into account when using the
        "Clear" button.
        - Improved: The "magnify" mode is finally displayed with a splitted
        screen where you can see both zoomed and unzoomed parts of the picture.

        "gfx2 /?" for the syntax).

        - Modified: The tool-bar has been reduced vertically by about 1/3.
        - Fixed: Bug in the Grid menu. (The user was able to enter a null grid
        step. Doh!)
        - Added: "Adjust brush pick" option.
        - Fixed: DP2e (LBM-"PBM") files (including new BBM files) with odd
        width are now loaded correctly.
        - Improved: LBM files are now saved with their exact width and not
        with a multiple-of-16 witdh (viewers that can't read these files are
        "badly coded" because we save them correctly).
        - Improved: The selector bar is now placed on last visited directory
        when you change directory.
        - Added: "Mask" drawing mode.
        - Added: "Smear" drawing mode.

        - Fixed: Bug of the shape of the cursor when a window is open in
        magnify mode.
        - Added: Special cursor shape for the pipette.
        - Modified: The method to recenter the page when exiting magnifier
        mode (the picture recovers its position as it was before zooming).

        - Added: You can now load and save brushes (from the Brush FX menu).
        - Fixed: A few video modes (Modes X with a height multiple of 270).

* GRAFX 2.00 Beta 96% (11/03/1997) - Saturne (aborted) party 5 release
        - Added: Now, you can increase or decrease the size of the paintbrush.
        The default keys are [,<] and [.>] ([;.] and [:/] for azerty).
        - Added: Typing the first letters of a filename in file-selectors will
        place the selection bar onto it.
        - Fixed: Small but annoying bugs in the writing of the GFX2.CFG file
        in GFXCFG. The data concerning Shade and Stencil modes were destroyed.
        - Added/Improved: It is now possible to define the matrix of the
        Smooth mode. We also seized the opportunity to improve the Smooth on
        the boundaries of the picture, and to improve the function that
        calculates nearest colors.
        - Added: The "Replace color" option that replaces all the pixels of
        the color pointed by the mouse with the paintbrush color. This tool is
        accessible by right clicking on the Floodfill button.
        - Improved: FloodFill slightly accelerated (especially with small
        surfaces).
        - Fixed: The picture was automatically zoomed when choosing a zoom
        factor in the menu if the Fast_zoom option was set.
        - Added: "Stretch brush".

        menu for picking a color that is behind it (with the key just below
        <Escape>).
        - Fixed: Small bug in "Menu_ratio=2" mode when remapping the screen
        after color changes.
        - Added: "Thin" cursor type (looks like VGApaint's one).
        - Fixed: A few video modes (Modes X with a height multiple of 224 and
        some others).
        - Added: It is now possible to select the colors that can be used for
        the smooth and transparency modes, and remapping.
        - Fixed: Clicking twice on the Lasso button did not restore the paint-
        brush correctly.
        - Fixed: the absolute coordinates option wasn't correctly saved in
        the .INI file.
        - Added: A few new parameters can be defined in the .INI file.
        - Added: "Copy palette to spare page and remap destination" option
        (accessible from the "Copy to spare page" menu (default: Shift+Tab)).

* GRAFX 2.00 Beta 96.1% (02/28/1998) - Volcanic Party 4 release
        - Fixed: File selector gauges don't bug any more when there are more
        than 584 entries :) in the current directory.
        - Fixed: The file selector _should_ hang no more on non-image (or
        corrupt image) files containing data that look like a known format
        signature.
        - Fixed: Old and horrible :) video bug. Most of the VESA video cards
        that displayed unexpected pixels (when moving the mouse for instance)
        should work better (perfectly?) now.
        - Fixed: The mouse correction factors didn't work properly.
        - Added: Quick-shade mode.
        - Improved: You can hide any menu that needs a color selection to pick
        up a color behind the window.
        - Added: A couple of new parameters in the GFX2.INI file.

* GRAFX 2.00 Alpha 96.3% (04/11/1998) - Lucky n' Tigrou Party 2 release
        !!! Warning: possibly unstable version !!!
        - Improved: You can edit pictures bigger than 1024x768, and small
        pictures take much less memory, allowing to have many more undo pages!
        - Improved: The list of undo pages is preserved when you load a
        picture, modify its size, or just go to the spare page.
        - Added: You can "kill" a page (i.e. removing it from the list of undo
        pages).
        - Modified: The Settings menu has been reorganized.
        - Improved: The drawing mode is no more set to "discontinuous" by
        default.
        - Improved: The function to compute the best matching RGB color used
        in smooth, colorize, and some other operations has been strongly
        accelerated on 486 and Cyrix processors, while it should be about the
        same speed or very slightly slower on Intel Pentiums (II) than before.
        - Fixed: The program finally works under Windows NT (without dos4gw)!

* GRAFX 2.00 Beta 96.5% (12/23/1999) - Xmas'99 release

        - Fixed: A few options on brushes kept modifying the continuity of the
        free-hand drawing mode.
        - Fixed: The "nibble brush" operation crashed sometimes.
        - Fixed: Remapping the screen after modifying colors in the palette
        editor displayed, in rare cases, unexpected pixels or even crashed.
        It didn't remap correctly the picture in "Magnify" mode, too.
        - Fixed: Catastrophic bug occuring when you "flood-filled" an area
        starting at the bottom of the picture.
        - Added: An option in GFX2.INI to tell if the number of colors used
        must be automatically calculated, and another one for the default
        video mode at startup.
        - Fixed: The colors of the menu are now correctly remapped when
        getting colors from the brush.
        - Added: Degas Elite's file formats (PI1,PC1,...) support.
        - Added: True-color BMP (Windows) and PCX images can be loaded. They
        will be converted to a 256-color image with palette optimization and
        Floyd/Steinberg dithering. Note: some other true-color formats will be
        added in the next release.
        - Fixed: Loading corrupt pictures with null dimensions could crash.
        - Improved: Brush streching is now in "real time" (and snaps to the
        grid if "Adjust brush picking" is set).
        - Added: Brush rotation by any angle.
